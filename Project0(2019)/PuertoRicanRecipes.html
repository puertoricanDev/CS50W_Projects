        <p class= "AddMargin">Hello from Puerto Rico! As a Puerto Rican, I want to show some delicacies of our culture. For me, the best way is to share my secrets with one vegetable that can be used differently as many other cultures are used to. This veggie is the plantain. Many Americans get confused with bananas since they look almost identically. When you learn to cook green plantains you rise your palette to the next level.

        <ul><h2>Here are three awesome recipes with green platain:</h2>

            <li>
              <h3><span class="recipe">Mofongo:</span></h3>
                  One of the most important dishes of our culture must have mofongo. The mofongo consist of deep fried-green plantain portions then smashed in a wooden mortar with spices and olive oil. The result is amazing.

            <li>
              <h3><span class="recipe">Spiders:</span></h3>
                  A really fun plate to eat is called plantain spiders. The plantain spiders are made with green plantain shredded then put together like hashbrowns and deep-fried. The result is a really unique form with crunchy delicious taste.

            <li>
              <h3><span class="recipe">Tostones:</span></h3>
                  The perfect side would be tostones. This beautiful creation goes perfectly with any protein. The tostones are deep-fried portions of green plantain then they are flattened and deep-fried again. The result is this disk-shaped goodness filled with flavor.
