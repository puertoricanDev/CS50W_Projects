My project was a crazy idea to make my favorite recipes from the same fruit which is confused with bananas.  The main page is PuertoRicanRecipes.html and is linked to different recipes. The main page describes the three recipes. I have made two CSS files: style.css is for the main page for the video banner on the header and style1.css which is made in a saas file called style1.scss. The file made in sass is used by the recipes pages. Included the pictures and the video in the directory. 
Additional info would be that those are real recipes and are really good! I encourage you to try them! Thanks I love how I am learning.
